| Ryzen 9                   | Enthusiast-level performance, excels in demanding tasks. |

### U vs H_ Series Processor
Both above mention companies have them. But which one to choose?


| U Series   | H_ series |
|------------|----------|
| Basic tasks and casual gaming. | High-performance tasks like video editing and demanding gaming. |
| Excellent battery life for longer usage away from outlets. | More powerful with higher core counts and clock speeds. |
| Lower heat generation for thinner and lighter laptops. | Generates more heat, requires better cooling solutions. |

## 3. GPU - Empowering Visual Grandeur

The graphics processing unit (GPU) is pivotal for visuals and gaming.

### Integrated GPUs (iGPU):

- **Pros**:
  - cost-effectiveness
  - Enhanced battery life
  - sleek design
  - reduced fan noise
- **AMD's Edge**: Current-gen AMD iGPUs rival Nvidia's **GTX** lineup.

### Dedicated GPUs (dGPU):

| Factors | |
|---------|-|
| **VRAM** | Opt for 6GB VRAM or more for seamless experience. |
| **Generation Impact** | Prioritize newer GPU generations for features. |
| **TGP (Total Graphics Power)** | Affects performance and thermals. Higher is better, consuming more power. |
| **Strategic Bottlenecking** | Optimal performance results when the dGPU is the bottleneck, ensuring full GPU utilization. |
- **Nvidia** is not recommended for platform other than **Windows**.

## 4. RAM - Powering Your Multitasking Adventures

Random access memory (RAM) serves as your laptop's short-term memory hub. Here are pivotal considerations:
- **Dual-channel Efficiency**: Opt for identical dual-channel RAM sticks for better performance.
- **Banishing Bottlenecks**: Adequate RAM averts system freezes from memory limitations.
- **Optimal 'x' Selection**: x8 stick outperforms x16; more details [here](https://youtu.be/v8g1_fjmReM).

| **Size**                  |          |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Absolute Minimum          | 8GB      |
| Recommended               | 2GB per job i.e. 2GB per thread for complete utilization of CPU |
| Intensive tasks like rendering | Benefits from higher RAM capacities |

## 5. Storage - Swift and Responsive

- Embrace the future: bid farewell to mechanical drives.
- Opt for the revolutionized speed of NVMe or SSDs.

## 6. Display - Elevating Visual Elegance

Your laptop's display is your primary portal. Consider the following factors.

- **Touch Screen**: Intuitive engagement with the system.
- **LED**: Say goodbye to LCDs
  | **Type** | **Advantages** |
  |--------------|----------------|
  | OLED         | Exceptional contrast, advancements curbing burn-in concerns. |
  | Mini LED     | Great contrast but not as good as OLED, no burn-in concerns. |
  | Micro LED    | Cutting-edge, harboring various refinements. |
- **Refresh Rate**: Elevated rates translate to smoother visuals. For gaming, prioritize refresh rate if your GPU sustains that much FPS. A 120Hz minimum is recommended for laptop gaming.

## 7. Battery - A Pivotal Lifesaver
